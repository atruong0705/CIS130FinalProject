                <h3>About Me</h3>
                <p>Hi, my name is An Truong. This website is a collection of the resources that helped me survive and pass CIS 130. To be honest this semester in general has been a struggle to balance along with my new job, but it was good to learn alot of new things</p>
                
                <h3>Why I took this course</h3>
                <p>I took this course to learn the fundamentals of how the web works and wanted to move beyond just using websites to actually understanding the code that builds them. And to be honest the main reason for taking this class is because it was one of my requirements</p>
